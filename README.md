## Hey there, I'm Dane 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub.

I'm a software tinkerer, builder of things, and currently working on a personal AI assistant called **Spoke** — a voice-driven sidekick that keeps my digital life organized (or tries to, anyway).

### 🔧 What I'm building:
- 🧠 **Spoke** – a smart CLI assistant with memory, scheduling, and financial insight features
- 🛠️ Tooling to make my workflows smoother, smarter, and more sarcastic

### 🌱 What I'm learning:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Software architecture for personal agents
- How not to break production with one-liners

### 🤝 Looking to collaborate on:
- Experimental AI projects
- Anything involving Python, automation, or human-centric tooling

### 📫 How to reach me:
- GitHub: [@danejbrown](https://github.com/danejbrown)
- Email: probably in the commit history 😅
